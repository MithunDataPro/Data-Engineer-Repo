# Important File Formats Every Data Engineer & Big Data Engineer Should Know

Data engineers and big data engineers work with large volumes of data in various formats. Understanding these formats is crucial for efficient data storage, retrieval, and processing. Below is a detailed explanation of key file formats, including **structured**, **semi-structured**, and **unstructured** formats commonly used in data engineering.

## 1. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
**JSON** is a lightweight, text-based, semi-structured data format that is commonly used to represent structured data. It is easily readable by humans and machines, making it a popular choice for web applications, APIs, and data interchange between systems.

### Features:
- **Data Type**: Semi-structured
- **Use Cases**: APIs, configurations, web data, logs, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB
- **Readable Format**: Easy to read and write for both humans and machines.
- **Self-Describing**: Data is described using key-value pairs.

### Pros:
- Human-readable format.
- Widely supported across programming languages and platforms.
- Simple to parse and generate.

### Cons:
- Larger file size compared to binary formats like Parquet.
- Limited support for complex data types.

### Example:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zipcode": "10001"
  }
}
```
