### Cons:
- Larger file size compared to binary formats like Parquet.
- Limited support for complex data types.

### Example:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zipcode": "10001"
  }
}
```

- **Efficient Storage**: Avro is compact and supports efficient serialization/deserialization.

### Pros:
- Compact binary format reduces storage size.
- Schema-based, ensuring that data is self-describing.
- Efficient for write-heavy workloads.

### Cons:
- Not human-readable (binary format).
- Less optimized for read-heavy analytical queries compared to Parquet.

### Example:
An Avro file contains both the schema and the serialized data in binary format, making it fast but not human-readable.

### Example:
```xml
<person>
  <name>John Doe</name>
  <age>30</age>
  <address>
    <city>New York</city>
    <zipcode>10001</zipcode>
  </address>
</person>

```
