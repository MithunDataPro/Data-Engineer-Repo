## What‚Äôs common between Machine Learning and us?

Machine Learning is an art. It is an art in which the computer learns. We start learning since we were infants and continue to grow and develop ourselves. Similarly, we have models in Machine Learning which are like infants. They do not know anything by themselves. They have to learn from the data similar to the way we humans learn. To make these infant models learn we need to take a closer look at how humans learn. Then we can try to simulate this idea of learning to our models.

Human learning is highly accurate and very reliable. It is very logical to have mechanisms for a computer to learn very similar to the way humans learn.

Let us understand ‚ÄúThe Art‚Äù of how humans learn and relate it back to Machine Learning.

### The Three Arts of Learning:

#### Supervised Learning:
The first art is supervised learning. Most of the things that we learn are taught by others, that is someone else supervises our task. Suppose you are learning football, the coach might have shown you a video of dribbling, you now try to simulate the same thing. This is called learning under supervision or guided training, also technically called supervised learning.

### How does this link back to Machine Learning?

In Machine Learning we need to train models. These models try to simulate what we do in our brains. They simulate the way we learn and try to understand the given data the way we do.

Let‚Äôs take an example to get our heads clear.
How do we recognize if the given animal is a dog or cat and classify accordingly?

Your mother (your first teacher) might have shown you a labelled image of a cat and told you this is a cat. Also, she would have shown you a labelled image of a dog and said that this is a dog. Eventually, with multiple real-world examples, your brain learnt to distinguish between dog and cat.

Similarly, it would make sense if we give our model some kind of labelled data to learn i.e. we would give it multiple images saying this is a dog and multiple images saying this is a cat. The model will have to learn from this data and in the end, be correctly able to distinguish dog and cat.

This art of learning is called supervised learning. Supervised learning is used when we have labelled data, that is data with some input and well-known output.

But wait‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

You learnt how to distinguish between dog and cat by seeing the images and training your brain.

How will the model ‚Äúlearn‚Äù to distinguish between dog and cat?

For this, we need a learning algorithm which I will tell you soon.
(Hold on guys üòÅ I can‚Äôt tell all the story at once)

Let us move to the second art.
