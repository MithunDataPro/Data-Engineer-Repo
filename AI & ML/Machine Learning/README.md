# Types of Machine Learning and Algorithms

## 1. Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, meaning the input comes with the correct output. The goal is to predict the output based on new inputs.

### Algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Random Forests**
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
- **Naive Bayes**

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns from data without labeled outcomes, identifying patterns and structures.

### Algorithms:
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Hierarchical Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
- **Autoencoders**
- **Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)**

---

## 3. Semi-Supervised Learning
This type of learning is a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a larger amount of unlabeled data.

### Algorithms:
- **Label Propagation**
- **Self-Training**
- **Co-Training**
- **Generative Models (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models)**

## 4. Reinforcement Learning
In reinforcement learning, an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward.

### Algorithms:
- **Q-Learning**
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**
- **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action)**
- **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)**
- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
- **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**

---

## 5. Self-Supervised Learning
This is a type of learning where the model generates its own labels based on the data it sees. It is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision.

### Algorithms:
- **Contrastive Learning**
- **Masked Language Models (e.g., BERT)**
- **SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations)**

---

## 6. Online Learning
Online learning refers to models that update themselves continuously as new data becomes available, often in real-time scenarios.

### Algorithms:
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
- **Passive-Aggressive Algorithms**
- **Online Decision Trees**
- **Online Ensemble Learning (e.g., Adaptive Boosting)**

---

## 7. Transfer Learning
In transfer learning, a pre-trained model is adapted to a new, but related problem. Commonly used in deep learning for image and text processing.

### Algorithms:
- **Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Models (e.g., BERT, GPT, ResNet)**
- **Feature-Based Transfer**
