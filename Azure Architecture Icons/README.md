# Azure Architecture Icons

Helping our customers design solutions is core to the Azure Architecture Center's mission. Architecture diagrams like those included in our guidance can help communicate design decisions and the relationships between components of a given workload.

On this page, you'll find an official collection of Azure architecture icons, including Azure product icons, to help you build custom architecture diagrams for your next solution.

To learn more about communicating design intent, see [Architecture Design Diagrams in the Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/).
