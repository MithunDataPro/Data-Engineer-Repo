## Getting Started Guides

### MLflow Tracking:
[MLflow Tracking Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking) is one of the primary service components of MLflow. In these guides, you will gain an understanding of what MLflow Tracking can do to enhance your MLOps related activities while building ML models.

**In these introductory guides to MLflow Tracking, you will learn how to leverage MLflow to:**

- Log training statistics (loss, accuracy, etc.) and hyperparameters for a model

- Log (save) a model for later retrieval

- Register a model using the [MLflow Model Registry]](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#registry) to enable deployment

- Load the model and use it for inference

In the process of learning these key concepts, you will be exposed to the MLflow Tracking APIs, the MLflow Tracking UI, and learn how to add metadata associated with a model training event to an MLflow run.
