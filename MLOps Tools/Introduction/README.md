# What is MLOps? 
**MLOps**, or **Machine Learning Operations**, is a set of practices that aims to deploy, manage, and maintain **machine learning models** in production reliably and efficiently. It integrates practices from **DevOps**, **data engineering**, and **machine learning**, focusing on automating workflows, tracking model performance, and ensuring data quality for models in production.
