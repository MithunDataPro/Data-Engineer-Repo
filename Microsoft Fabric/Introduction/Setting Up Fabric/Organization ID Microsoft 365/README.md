# Creating an Organizational Outlook Mail with Microsoft 365 Developer to Use with Microsoft Fabric

Yes, you can create an organizational Outlook mail account with a Microsoft 365 Developer subscription and use it with Microsoft Fabric. Here's how:

## 1. Sign up for Microsoft 365 Developer Program
- Go to the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) and sign up for a free account. This gives you access to a Microsoft 365 E5 sandbox with Outlook and other Office apps.

## 2. Create Organizational Email
- After signing up, youâ€™ll be assigned a default domain (e.g., `yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com`). You can create users with email addresses like `user@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com`.
- Create multiple users and assign them different roles depending on your organization's needs.

## 3. Set Up Outlook
- Once your users are created, they can use Outlook for organizational communication. Microsoft 365 Developer includes full access to Outlook and Exchange Online, which allows you to send and receive emails using your organizational domain.

## 4. Integrate with Microsoft Fabric
- You can use this organizational email to communicate, manage projects, or send notifications as part of your Microsoft Fabric workflows or pipelines.
- Microsoft Fabric integrates with other Azure services, so you can leverage these tools in your data engineering, data analytics, or data governance workflows.

By following these steps, you'll have a working organizational Outlook email that integrates with Microsoft Fabric for better communication and collaboration
