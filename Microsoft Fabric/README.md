# Microsoft Fabric: OneLake and Real-Time Hub

## OneLake: The Unification of Lakehouses
The Microsoft Fabric platform unifies the OneLake and lakehouse architecture across an enterprise.

### What is OneLake?
A data lake is the foundation on which all the Fabric workloads are built. Microsoft Fabric Lake is also known as **OneLake**. OneLake is built into the Fabric platform and provides a unified location to store all organizational data where the workloads operate.

- **Built on ADLS (Azure Data Lake Storage) Gen2**: OneLake provides a single SaaS experience and a tenant-wide store for data, serving both professional and citizen developers. 
- **Simplified Experience**: OneLake simplifies Fabric experiences by eliminating the need to understand infrastructure concepts such as resource groups, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), Azure Resource Manager, redundancy, or regions. You don't need an Azure account to use Fabric.
- **Eliminating Data Silos**: OneLake eliminates data silos that individual developers often create when provisioning their own storage accounts. Instead, it provides a unified storage system for all developers, ensuring easy data discovery, sharing, and uniform enforcement of policy and security settings.  
For more information, see [What is OneLake?](https://docs.microsoft.com/onelake/).

### OneLake and Lakehouse Data Hierarchy
OneLake is hierarchical in nature to simplify management across your organization. There's only **one OneLake per tenant**, and it provides a single-pane-of-glass file-system namespace that spans across users, regions, and clouds. OneLake organizes data into manageable containers for easy handling.

- **Tenant**: The tenant maps to the root of OneLake and is at the top level of the hierarchy.
- **Workspaces**: You can create multiple workspaces (similar to folders) within a tenant. 
- **Lakehouses**: A lakehouse is a collection of files, folders, and tables that represent a database over a data lake.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be76d4be-fad3-4714-8999-43ebbc2885ad)

Every developer and business unit in the tenant can easily create their own workspaces in OneLake, ingest data into their own lakehouses, and start processing, analyzing, and collaborating on the dataâ€”similar to how OneDrive works in Microsoft Office.

For more information, see [What is a lakehouse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/lakehouse/).

### OneLake Integration
All Microsoft Fabric compute experiences, such as **Data Engineering**, **Data Warehouse**, **Data Factory**, **Power BI**, and **Real-Time Intelligence**, are prewired to OneLake. These experiences use OneLake as their native store without requiring extra configuration.

- **Shortcut Feature**: OneLake allows instant mounting of your existing Platform as a Service (PaaS) storage accounts into OneLake with the Shortcut feature. No need to migrate or move your existing data. You can use shortcuts to access data stored in **Azure Data Lake Storage**.
- **Data Sharing**: Shortcuts allow easy sharing of data between users and applications without duplicating information. You can create shortcuts to other storage systems, enabling you to compose and analyze data across clouds with transparent, intelligent caching that reduces egress costs and brings data closer to compute.
