# AWS S3 Bucket Top-Level Interview Questions

## 1. What is AWS S3?
**Answer:**  
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, including websites, mobile apps, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.

## 2. How does S3 ensure high durability of my data?
**Answer:**  
AWS S3 provides **99.999999999%** (11 nines) of durability for objects stored in S3. It automatically creates and stores copies of all S3 objects across multiple devices in multiple facilities in an AWS region. This redundancy ensures that even if part of the infrastructure fails, data remains intact.

## 3. What are S3 Buckets?
**Answer:**  
S3 buckets are the containers that hold your data (objects) in S3. Each object is stored in a bucket, and each bucket has a globally unique name. Buckets are used to organize the S3 namespace at the highest level.

## 4. What is the maximum size of an S3 object?
**Answer:**  
The maximum size for a single object in S3 is **5TB**. For larger objects, **multipart upload** allows uploading parts of a single object concurrently, increasing efficiency and reducing the time to complete the upload.

## 5. Can you explain S3 versioning?
**Answer:**  
S3 Versioning allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in the same bucket. This is useful for **data recovery** and **backup** purposes. When versioning is enabled, any modification to an object creates a new version, and previous versions are preserved. Users can retrieve, restore, or permanently delete these versions when needed.

## 6. What is the difference between Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, and Glacier storage classes?
**Answer:**  
- **S3 Standard:** General-purpose storage with high durability, availability, and performance for frequently accessed data.
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering:** Moves data automatically between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent) based on changing access patterns, optimizing storage costs.
- **S3 Glacier:** Low-cost storage for long-term data archiving and backup with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.

## 7. How can you secure your data in S3?
**Answer:**  
Data in S3 can be secured using:
- **IAM Policies:** To control access to buckets and objects.
- **Bucket Policies:** To specify access permissions at the bucket level.
- **Encryption:** Data can be encrypted at rest using server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C) or client-side encryption.
- **Access Logs:** To track and audit S3 access.

## 8. What is an S3 lifecycle policy?
**Answer:**  
An S3 lifecycle policy allows you to define rules to **transition** objects between storage classes (e.g., from Standard to Glacier) or **expire** objects (delete them) after a specified period. This helps in optimizing storage costs by managing the lifecycle of objects.

## 9. What is Cross-Region Replication (CRR) in S3?
**Answer:**  
**Cross-Region Replication (CRR)** is a feature that replicates objects across different AWS regions. This ensures that you have a copy of your data in another region, improving **disaster recovery** and data availability. It can also help comply with certain geographic regulations.

## 10. What is S3 Transfer Acceleration?
**Answer:**  
S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. It leverages **Amazon CloudFrontâ€™s globally distributed edge locations** to accelerate data transfer.

## 11. What is S3 Object Lock?
**Answer:**  
**S3 Object Lock** enables you to store objects using a **WORM (Write Once Read Many)** model. It can be used to prevent objects from being deleted or modified for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. This is useful for **compliance and regulatory requirements**.

## 12. How do you monitor S3 access and activities?
**Answer:**  
Monitoring in S3 can be done using:
- **AWS CloudTrail** to log API calls and activities.
- **Amazon S3 Access Logs** to record details of the requests made to the bucket.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor operational metrics, such as the number of requests, data retrieval, and errors.

## 13. What is the difference between S3 and EBS?
**Answer:**  
- **S3** is an object storage service that stores data as objects inside buckets. It is ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured data.
- **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** is block storage designed to be used with EC2 instances for storing data that needs low-latency access and is commonly used for databases or OS files.

## 14. What are S3 Object Tags, and how are they used?
**Answer:**  
**S3 Object Tags** are key-value pairs that allow you to categorize and manage objects in S3. Tags can be used for **access control**, **cost allocation**, and **automating lifecycle policies**.

## 15. Can you use S3 for hosting static websites?
**Answer:**  
Yes, **S3 can host static websites**. You can configure an S3 bucket to host your website by storing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, making them publicly accessible via a custom domain or S3 endpoint.
