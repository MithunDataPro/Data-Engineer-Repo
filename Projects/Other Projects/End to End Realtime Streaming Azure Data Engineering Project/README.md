# Real-Time Weather Reporting System on Azure

This project aims to create a real-time weather reporting system that continuously updates with weather information such as temperature, conditions, and air quality for preferred locations. It also provides critical alerts in the event of extreme weather, ensuring a prompt response.

## **Architecture Overview**

### 1. **Data Source (Weather API)**
   - A live weather API provides real-time data, including **temperature**, **conditions**, and **air quality** for specified locations.

### 2. **Data Ingestion**
   - **Azure Databricks**: Used for data processing, transformations, and handling large volumes of streaming data.
   - **Azure Functions**: Serverless functions trigger data pulls at regular intervals, enabling scalable ingestion.

### 3. **Data Streaming**
   - **Azure Event Hub**: Acts as the streaming data pipeline, handling real-time data flow from ingestion to processing systems.

### 4. **Event Processing and Reporting**
   - **Event Stream**: Processes incoming data in real time to ensure low-latency insights.
   - **Kusto (Azure Data Explorer)**: Stores processed data, enabling high-speed analytics for real-time intelligence and insights.
   - **Power BI**: Provides visualization of weather data in dashboards, updating as new data flows in.

### 5. **Real-Time Intelligence & Alerts**
   - **Data Activator**: Sends real-time alerts through email or SMS for unexpected or extreme weather conditions.
   - **Monitoring & Alerting**: Ensures the system is continuously monitored for performance and data quality.

### 6. **Security & Management**
   - **Azure Key Vault**: Stores API keys securely to access the weather API.
   - **Cost Management**: Monitors and optimizes spending on Azure resources.

## **Key Features**

- **Real-Time Weather Insights**: Continuously updated with live weather conditions.
- **Critical Alerts**: Sends alerts via email for extreme conditions, ensuring a prompt response.
- **Scalable & Secure**: Leverages Azure services for efficient data processing and secure access.

## **Project Outcome**:

This setup results in a fully automated system that provides live weather insights and critical alerts, helping users respond quickly to adverse weather conditions. The project structure ensures **data integrity**, **security**, and **scalability** for real-time data engineering applications on Azure.
