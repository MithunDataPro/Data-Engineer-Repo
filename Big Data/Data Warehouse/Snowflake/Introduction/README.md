# Data Engineering Life Cycle

The Data Engineering Life Cycle involves the following stages:

### 1. **Generation**
- **Source**: Data is generated from websites, sensors, forms/feedback, and analytics.

### 2. **Ingestion**
- **Process**: Data is fetched from multiple sources.

### 3. **Storage**
- **Purpose**: Store all the fetched data for further use.

### 4. **Transformation**
- **Action**: Apply business logic and requirements to process and prepare the data.

### 5. **Serving**
- **Output**: Deliver data for analytics, machine learning, or reverse ETL through systems like data warehouses.

### **Undercurrents**
- Supportive elements like **Security**, **Data Management**, **DataOps**, **Data Architecture**, **Orchestration**, and **Software Engineering** ensure the pipeline runs effectively.

# What is a Data Warehouse?

A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized repository where data from multiple sources—such as transactional systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL), applications (e.g., Instagram, Facebook), and external sources—is stored.

The primary purpose of a data warehouse is to support **business intelligence activities**, including:
- Generating **analytics**.
- Producing **reports**.
- Performing **data mining**.

## Characteristics of a Data Warehouse

1. **Subject-Oriented**  
   - Organizes data by specific business subjects (e.g., sales, customers, inventory) rather than by application.

2. **Integrated**  
   - Combines data from multiple sources into a consistent format, ensuring unified definitions and structure.

3. **Time-Variant**  
   - Maintains historical data, allowing tracking of changes over time for better analysis.

4. **Non-Volatile**  
   - Once data is stored, it remains unchanged. Updates are handled through new records rather than overwriting.

## Benefits of a Data Warehouse

1. **Improved Decision Making**  
   - Provides actionable insights by enabling complex analysis and data-driven decisions.

2. **Increased Efficiency**  
   - Simplifies and accelerates access to data for reporting and analytics.

3. **Enhanced Data Quality**  
   - Consolidates and cleanses data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

4. **Competitive Advantage**  
   - Allows businesses to identify trends and make strategic moves faster than competitors.

### Workflow
1. **ETL Process**: Extract data from sources like CRM, ERP, billing systems, and flat files.
2. **Data Storage**: Centralize in the Data Warehouse.
3. **Output**: Use data for reporting, analytics, and data mining.
