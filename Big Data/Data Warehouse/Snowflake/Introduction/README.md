# Data Engineering Life Cycle

The Data Engineering Life Cycle involves the following stages:

### 1. **Generation**
- **Source**: Data is generated from websites, sensors, forms/feedback, and analytics.

### 2. **Ingestion**
- **Process**: Data is fetched from multiple sources.

### 3. **Storage**
- **Purpose**: Store all the fetched data for further use.

### 4. **Transformation**
- **Action**: Apply business logic and requirements to process and prepare the data.

### 5. **Serving**
- **Output**: Deliver data for analytics, machine learning, or reverse ETL through systems like data warehouses.

### **Undercurrents**
- Supportive elements like **Security**, **Data Management**, **DataOps**, **Data Architecture**, **Orchestration**, and **Software Engineering** ensure the pipeline runs effectively.
