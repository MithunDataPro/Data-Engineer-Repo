# Snowflake - Introduction

Snowflake is a cloud-based advanced data platform system, provided as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Snowflake provides features of data storage from AWS S3, Azure, Google Cloud, processing complex queries and different analytic solutions. The analytic solutions provided by Snowflake are faster, easy to use and more flexible than traditional databases and their analytics features. Snowflake stores and provides data near time, not in actual real-time.

Snowflake is an advanced solution for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) technology. OLAP is also known as online data retrieving and data analysis system using historical data. It processes complex and aggregated queries with a low number of transactions. For example: getting the number of orders, sales amount in the last month for a company, number of new users in the company in the last quarter, etc. Snowflake is not used as an OLTP (Online Transactional Processing) database. OLTP databases usually contain real-time data with a high volume of small data transactions. For example: inserting customer order details, registering a new customer, tracking order delivery status, etc.

## Why Use Snowflake?

- Snowflake provides Data Platform as a Cloud Service.
- There is no hardware, neither virtual nor physical, to select, install, configure, or manage from the client side.
- There is no software to install, configure, or manage to access it.
- All ongoing maintenance, management, upgrades, and patching are owned by Snowflake itself.

Traditional databases for analytics solutions are complex in architecture, costly, and constrained, while Snowflake is rich in the concept of Data Engineering, Data Lake concept, data warehouse, Data Science, Data Application, and Data Exchange or sharing. It is easy to access and use without having the constraint of data size and storage capacity. The user must administrate only their data; all data platform-related administrations are done by Snowflake itself.

Apart from these, Snowflake also has the following features:

- Simple, reliable data pipelines in multiple languages like Java, Python, PHP, Spark, Ruby, etc.
- Secured access, very good performance, and security of the data lake.
- Zero administration for tool, data storage, and data size.
- Simple data preparation for modeling with any framework.
- No operational burden to build data-intensive applications.
- Share and collaborate live data across the company's ecosystem.
