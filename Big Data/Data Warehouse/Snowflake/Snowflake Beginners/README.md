# Snowflake - Data Architecture:

**Snowflake** data architecture re-invents a new SQL query engine. It is designed for the cloud only. Snowflake doesn't utilize or built on top of any existing database technology. It doesn't even use big data software platforms like Hadoop. Snowflake provides all functionalities of an analytical database plus numbers of additional unique features and capabilities to users.

Snowflake has central data repository for storage of structured and semi-structured data. These data can be accessed from all available compute nodes in the Snowflake platform. It uses virtual warehouse as compute environment for processing the queries. While processing queries, it utilizes multi-cluster, micro-partitioning and advanced cache concepts. Snowflake's cloud services are responsible to provide end to end solution to the user like logging validation of user to result of select queries.

Snowflake's data architecture **has three main layers** −

- Database Storage
- Query Processing
- Cloud Services

Following is the **data architecture** diagram of Snowflake −
