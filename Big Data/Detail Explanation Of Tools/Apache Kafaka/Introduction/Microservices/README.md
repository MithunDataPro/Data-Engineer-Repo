## What are Microservices?

**Microservices** is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service in a microservices architecture is responsible for a specific business function, and these services communicate with each other via well-defined APIs (typically HTTP, REST, or messaging systems like Kafka).

In simpler terms, microservices break down a large, complex application into smaller, manageable services, each handling a single responsibility. This makes them easier to develop, scale, and maintain over time.

In this article, we are going to learn **Microservices Architecture** and **Best Practices** when designing any software architecture for our projects.

By this article, we are going to learn **Microservices Architecture**, **Benefits** and **Challenges of Microservices Architecture**, and design our **E-Commerce application** with **Microservices Architecture**.

## Architecture Design Journey
There are many approaches and patterns that evolved over decades of software development, and all have their own benefits and challenges.

### What are Microservices ?
**Microservices** are small, independent, and **loosely coupled services**. So **Microservices** are small business services that can work together and can be **deployed independently** and autonomously. Each service is a separate codebase, which can be managed by a small development team. A single small team of developers can write and maintain a particular microservice.

Microservices communicate with each other over the **network protocols**. Services communicate with each other by using **well-defined APIs**. **Internal implementation details** of each service are hidden from other services. One of the biggest advantages is that they can be **deployed independently**. Microservices can be deployed independently. A team can update an existing service without rebuilding and redeploying the entire application.

**Services don’t need to share the same technology stack**, libraries, or frameworks. Microservices can work with many different **technology stacks** which is **technology agnostic**. **Microservices** have their own **database** or persistence layer that is not shared with other services. This differs from the traditional model, where a separate data layer handles data persistence.

### What is Microservices Architecture ?
**Microservices architecture** is an approach to software development that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services that communicate with each other through **APIs**.

In a **microservices architecture**, each service is responsible for a **specific business capability** or domain, and can be developed and deployed independently from the other services. This approach contrasts with a **monolithic architecture**, where all the functionality of the application is packaged into a single unit.

Microservices ([martinfowler.com](https://martinfowler.com)): The **microservice architectural style** is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an **HTTP** or **gRPC API**.

These services are built around **business capabilities** and are independently deployable by a **fully automated deployment process**. There is a bare minimum of **centralized management** of these services, which may be written in different **programming languages** and use different **data storage technologies**. The **microservice architecture** decomposes an application into **small independent services** that communicate over well-defined **APIs**.

Since each service can be developed and maintained by **autonomous teams**, it is the **most scalable** method for software development. These services are owned by **small, self-contained teams**. **Microservices architectures** make applications easier to **scale** and faster to **develop**, enabling innovation and accelerating **time-to-market** for new features.

So we can say that, **Microservices architecture** is a **cloud-native architectural approach** in which applications are composed of many **loosely coupled** and **independently deployable** smaller components. Microservices:

- Have their own **technology stack**, including the database and data management model.
- Communicate with each other over a combination of **REST APIs**, **event streaming**, and **message brokers**.
- Are organized by **business capability**, with the line separating services often referred to as a **bounded context**.

**Robert Martin** coined the term **single responsibility principle** that basically refers to **separating responsibilities** as per services. So we can follow the **SRP principles** when thinking of microservices.

A **microservices architecture** takes this same approach and extends it to the **loosely coupled services** which can be developed, deployed, and maintained **independently**. Each of these services is responsible for **different tasks** and can communicate with other services through **Restful APIs** in order to solve a larger complex business problem.

## Benefits of Microservices Architecture
The main benefits of microservices architecture include:

- **Scalability**: With microservices, each service can be **scaled independently**, allowing the application to handle increased traffic and load more easily.
- **Agility**: **Microservices architecture** enables faster **development cycles**, as each service can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
- **Resilience**: Because each service is **independent**, failures in one service do not necessarily affect the rest of the application.
- **Flexibility**: **Microservices** allow for more flexibility in **technology choices**, as each service can be developed using the most appropriate technology for its specific requirements.
- **Easy integration with third-party services**: **Microservices** can be easily integrated with third-party services, as each service can be developed with its own **API**.

## Drawbacks of Microservices Architecture
While **microservices architecture** offers several benefits, it also has some drawbacks that should be considered before implementing it:

- **Increased complexity**: **Microservices architecture** is more complex than traditional monolithic architecture, as it involves multiple services that communicate with each other. This can make development and maintenance more complex and require additional resources and expertise.
- **Distributed system challenges**: With **microservices architecture**, the services are **distributed across multiple servers**, which can create challenges related to **data consistency**, **network latency**, and **service discovery**.
- **Testing and debugging challenges**: **Testing and debugging** can be more complex in a **microservices architecture**, as there are multiple services that need to be tested and debugged independently, as well as **integration testing** across services.
- **Management overhead**: With **microservices architecture**, there is additional overhead associated with **managing multiple services**, including deployment, scaling, and monitoring.

## When to use Microservices ?
**Microservices architecture** is a good choice for **complex, large-scale applications** that require a high level of **scalability**, **availability**, and **agility**. It can also be a good fit for organizations that need to **integrate with multiple third-party services** or systems.

However, **microservices architecture** is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and it may not be the best choice for all applications. It requires **additional effort** in terms of **designing**, **implementing**, and **maintaining** the services, as well as managing the **communication between them**. Additionally, the overhead of **coordinating between services** can result in increased latency and decreased performance, so it may not be the best choice for applications that require **high performance** or **low latency**.

So, **Microservices architecture** is a good choice for organizations that require **high scalability, availability, and agility**, and are willing to invest in the **additional effort** required to design, implement, and maintain a microservices-based application.

### Key Characteristics of Microservices:

1. **Independence**:  
   Each microservice operates independently and is responsible for a specific task, which could be user authentication, order processing, inventory management, etc. They can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.

2. **Loosely Coupled**:  
   Microservices are loosely coupled, meaning that changes to one service do not typically require changes to another. This allows for faster development and more flexible updates.

3. **Scalability**:  
   Since each service is independent, microservices can be scaled individually depending on their load. For instance, an online shop might scale up the order processing service during a sale but keep the user authentication service at the same capacity.

4. **Technology Agnostic**:  
   Microservices can be built using different programming languages, databases, and frameworks. As long as they adhere to the agreed-upon API, the underlying technology stack doesn't matter.

5. **Continuous Delivery & Deployment**:  
   Microservices make it easier to deploy updates without affecting the entire system. Since each microservice is independent, it can be updated or rolled back without disrupting other services.

6. **Failure Isolation**:  
   If one microservice fails, it doesn’t bring down the entire system. Other microservices can continue to operate, and the failed service can be fixed or restarted independently.

### Example of Microservices in a Ride-Sharing Application

Consider a ride-sharing app like Uber or Lyft. The entire application can be broken down into several microservices, such as:

- **Ride Management Service**: Handles ride-related operations like booking, tracking, and completion.
- **Payment Service**: Processes payments and manages billing.
- **Notification Service**: Sends SMS or email notifications about ride updates.
- **Driver Management Service**: Manages drivers' availability, schedules, and information.
- **Fraud Detection Service**: Detects fraudulent activities, like fake rides or invalid payments.

These services work independently, and the architecture allows them to scale separately as per demand. For instance, during peak hours, the **Ride Management Service** may need more resources, whereas the **Notification Service** may have less demand.

### Communication Between Microservices

Microservices communicate with each other to exchange data, which can be achieved in several ways:

- **REST API**: Services communicate over HTTP using RESTful APIs.
- **Message Queues**: Messaging systems like **Apache Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** allow microservices to communicate asynchronously via messages.
- **gRPC**: A high-performance, open-source RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework that uses HTTP/2 for more efficient communication.

### Benefits of Microservices

- **Flexibility in Technology Stack**: Each microservice can use different technologies and databases suited to its specific task.
- **Improved Scalability**: Microservices can be scaled individually without scaling the entire application.
- **Faster Development**: Independent services allow teams to develop and deploy in parallel, leading to faster release cycles.
- **Better Fault Isolation**: Failures in one microservice don't affect the entire system, making it more resilient.

### Challenges of Microservices

- **Increased Complexity**: Managing multiple microservices can be more complex, especially in terms of communication, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Latency**: Communication between services over a network can introduce latency, especially if services are dependent on each other.
- **Data Management**: Each service might manage its own database, which can complicate data consistency across services.

### How Does Kafka Help Microservices?

In large systems with many microservices, coordination between services can be difficult. This is where **Apache Kafka** plays an important role as a messaging system that allows microservices to communicate asynchronously. For example:

- **Producers** publish messages to Kafka topics.
- **Consumers** subscribe to those topics to get the messages they need to process.

Kafka decouples services by providing a central system for communication, allowing services to subscribe to the data they need and process it independently.

### Conclusion

Microservices are a powerful architectural style that makes applications more scalable, flexible, and easier to maintain. However, they also introduce challenges in terms of communication, monitoring, and management, which can be mitigated by tools like Apache Kafka. By structuring an application into smaller, independently deployable services, organizations can develop, scale, and maintain their applications with greater efficiency.
