## Introduction:

That’s a crazy flow of water. Just like your application deals with a crazy stream of data. Routing data from one storage to another, applying validation rules and addressing questions of data governance, reliability in a Big Data ecosystem is hard to get right if you do it all by yourself.

Good news, you don’t have to build your dataflow solution from scratch — Apache NiFi got your back!

At the end of this article, you’ll be a NiFi expert — ready to build your data pipeline.

## What is Apache NiFi?

According to the official Apache NiFi project site, NiFi is defined as:

> **"An easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data."**

Let’s analyze these keywords:

---

### Defining NiFi

- **Process and distribute data:** NiFi moves data between systems and provides tools for processing this data. It can manage a variety of data sources and formats, allowing you to transform data from one source and push it to another.

- **Easy to use:** NiFi offers a flow-based programming experience. The drag-and-drop interface makes it possible to understand, at a glance, a dataflow that might take hundreds of lines of code to implement.

  **Consider The Pipeline Below:**

- **Powerful:** NiFi comes with a large number of processors out-of-the-box (293 in version 1.9.2). These processors handle the majority of use cases, and its concurrency capabilities ensure high performance while abstracting the complexity from users.

- **Reliable:** NiFi offers a high level of reliability through its flow-based architecture, data lineage, and provenance features, allowing users to track every piece of data through the entire lifecycle.

### Why Use NiFi?

NiFi is useful in scenarios where data flows need to be routed, validated, transformed, and enriched before being sent to multiple destinations. Key scenarios include handling a high variety of data sources, cleaning untrusted data, and managing different data schema. NiFi is especially suited for handling the four Vs of Big Data:

- **Volume**
- **Variety**
- **Velocity**
- **Veracity**

NiFi excels in environments where multiple data formats and sources must be processed in real-time, especially when low-trust data needs validation and cleaning.

## Apache NiFi Under the Microscope

### 1. **FlowFile**

- **Definition:** A FlowFile is the basic unit of data that moves through NiFi. It contains:
  - **Attributes:** Key/value pairs that describe the FlowFile.
  - **Content:** A reference to the actual data (not the data itself).

- **How It Works:** FlowFiles are processed and transformed by NiFi processors. The data itself is stored in the **Content Repository**, while the attributes are stored separately in the **FlowFile Repository**.

### 2. **Processor**

- **Definition:** Processors are the building blocks of NiFi’s dataflow. Each processor performs an operation on FlowFiles, such as routing, transforming, or enriching data.

- **How It Works:** Processors can operate concurrently and are configurable through a user-friendly interface.

### 3. **Process Group**

- **Definition:** A Process Group is a collection of processors that work together to complete a specific task. It allows for the modular design of dataflows.

### 4. **Connection**

- **Definition:** Connections link processors together and serve as queues for FlowFiles, allowing data to flow from one processor to another. Connections buffer data in case processors work at different rates.

### 5. **Flow Controller**

- **Definition:** The Flow Controller is the brain of NiFi, managing the scheduling and execution of processors and ensuring that data moves smoothly through the system.

## NiFi Terminology and Concepts

### FlowFile Repository

- **Definition:** The FlowFile Repository logs the state of each FlowFile, ensuring data integrity during system failures.

### Provenance Repository

- **Definition:** Tracks the history of every FlowFile and records every action performed on the data. Provides data lineage for auditing purposes.

### Processor Groups

- **Definition:** Processors are grouped into "Processor Groups" to modularize data pipelines. You can scale processing by running multiple processors concurrently within a group.

### Connections

- **Definition:** Connections act as queues that buffer FlowFiles between processors. They ensure processors with different speeds work together efficiently.

---

## NiFi’s Reliability

NiFi guarantees data delivery through its use of FlowFile and Provenance repositories. These ensure that data can be tracked, replayed, and recovered even after system failures.

### Backpressure

- **Definition:** NiFi uses backpressure to prevent overloads by stopping upstream processors when downstream connections are full. This helps in controlling dataflow rate through the pipeline.

---

## NiFi Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Definition:** NiFi can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to a cluster. Each node shares processing duties, improving overall throughput.

---

## FlowFile Attributes vs Content

- **Attributes:** Metadata about the FlowFile.
- **Content:** The actual data content, stored in the Content Repository.

---

## Provenance and Data Lineage

NiFi’s **Provenance Repository** allows you to trace the entire journey of a FlowFile, providing full data lineage. This is critical for auditing, compliance, and debugging purposes.

### Replay Feature

- **Definition:** NiFi’s replay feature allows you to reprocess data from any point in its lifecycle.

---

## Should You Use Apache NiFi?

NiFi is ideal if you’re dealing with multiple data sources or need to route, validate, and transform data in real-time. It offers robust features for data governance, concurrency, and scalability.

- **When to Use:** If you work in environments with Big Data or IoT, NiFi's ability to handle high volumes and varied data sources is a game-changer.
- **When to Avoid:** If your data flows are simple or involve trusted, structured data sources, simpler ETL tools may suffice.

## Conclusion

NiFi is an advanced, powerful, and reliable solution for automating dataflows in complex systems. Its intuitive design and powerful processors make it an excellent choice for handling Big Data pipelines, IoT data ingestion, and enterprise dataflows.
