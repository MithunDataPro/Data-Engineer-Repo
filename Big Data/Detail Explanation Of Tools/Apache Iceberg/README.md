## What is Apache Iceberg?

**Apache Iceberg** is an open-source table format for managing large-scale data sets in a data lake environment. It provides a way to structure and query data efficiently without compromising the scalability of a data lake. Iceberg ensures that data is immutable and enables features like schema evolution, version control, and ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) compliance for big data storage.
