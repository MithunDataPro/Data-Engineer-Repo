# Apache Sqoop Overview
**Apache Sqoop** is a **command-line interface application** used to transfer data between **relational databases** and **Hadoop**. It efficiently imports and exports large datasets between **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)** and structured data stores like **relational databases (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.)**. **Sqoop** automates the process, minimizing manual coding, and provides connectors for popular databases.


## Why Data Engineers Use Apache Sqoop

**Data engineers leverage Apache Sqoop for several reasons:**

- **Data Migration:** Efficiently migrates large datasets from relational databases to Hadoop for processing and analytics.
- **Batch Processing:** Integrates with batch processing engines like Hadoop's MapReduce, making it easy to handle high-volume data migration tasks.
- **ETL Pipeline:** Frequently used in Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines to ingest relational data into data lakes or distributed file systems.
- **Integration with BI Tools:** Provides connectors for Business Intelligence (BI) tools and other big data ecosystems, allowing seamless data movement.
