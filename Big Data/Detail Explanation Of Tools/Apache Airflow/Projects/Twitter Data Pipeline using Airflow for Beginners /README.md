# Twitter Data Pipeline Project

## Project Overview

In this project, we will set up a data pipeline to extract data from Twitter, process it with Python, and store the results in Amazon S3. The workflow is orchestrated with Apache Airflow running on an Amazon EC2 instance.

### Project Flow

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract data from Twitter using the Twitter API.
2. **Data Transformation**: Use Python to transform the data into the required format.
3. **Orchestration with Airflow**: Deploy the workflow in Apache Airflow to automate the pipeline.
4. **Data Storage**: Store the processed data in Amazon S3.

## Prerequisites

- **Laptop** with Internet connection
- **Python** (version 3.5 or above)
- Basic knowledge of Python
- **AWS Account** for accessing EC2 and S3 services
- **Discipline** and consistency in following through with the project steps

## Key Concepts and Tools

### Twitter API
- Twitter provides APIs to access data from its platform.
- We will use the **Tweepy** Python library to interact with the Twitter API.
- Extracted data will be transformed with **Pandas** and stored in a structured format.

### Apache Airflow
- **Airflow** is a workflow orchestration tool that allows for creating and managing workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
- A **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a collection of tasks with dependencies.
- Each **Task** is a unit of operation, such as data extraction or transformation.
- **Operators** are templates in Airflow that define different types of tasks, including:
  - **BashOperator**: For executing bash commands
  - **PythonOperator**: For executing Python code
  - Custom Operators can also be created for specialized tasks.

### Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- **EC2**: An Amazon EC2 instance will host Apache Airflow.
- **S3**: Transformed data will be stored in an S3 bucket for further analysis or archiving.

## Execution Steps

1. **Extract Data from Twitter**:
   - Use Tweepy to connect to the Twitter API and extract data based on specified parameters.

2. **Transform Data**:
   - Process and clean the data using Python and Pandas.
   - Structure the data to fit our storage requirements.

3. **Deploy Workflow in Airflow**:
   - Define the data pipeline as a DAG in Airflow.
   - Use different Operators to break down the pipeline into tasks, such as extraction, transformation, and storage.

4. **Store Data in S3**:
   - Transfer the transformed data to Amazon S3 for persistent storage.

   This diagram represents the flow of data from Twitter, through Python for transformation, into Apache Airflow on an EC2 instance, and finally to Amazon S3 for storage.

2. **Airflow DAG Structure**:

   This diagram shows the Airflow DAG structure, with each task represented as an operation in the workflow, connected in a directed acyclic manner.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build a data pipeline for extracting, processing, and storing Twitter data using Python, Apache Airflow, and AWS services. This setup is scalable and can be expanded to include additional data sources or more complex transformations as needed.
