The error message indicates that the `python3-venv` package, which is required to create virtual environments, is not installed on your Ubuntu system. Additionally, the command to install it failed because it wasn’t run with `sudo` (administrator privileges). Here’s how to resolve this:

### Step 1: Install `python3-venv` with `sudo`
Run the following command to install **`python3-venv`** with **`sudo`**:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3.12-venv

```

If you have a different Python version (e.g., Python 3.8 or Python 3.10), you can also try:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3-venv

```

This will install the **venv** module, allowing you to create virtual environments.

### Step 2: Create the Virtual Environment Again
After **python3-venv** is installed, you can proceed to create a virtual environment:

##### 1. Go to your project directory:
```bash
cd ~/airflow_project

```

##### 2. Create a virtual environment named venv:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv

```

---

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment and Install Packages
Once the virtual environment is created, activate it and install the required packages:

##### 1. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate

```

##### 2. Install packages within the virtual environment:
```bash
pip install apache-airflow
pip install pandas
pip install s3fs
pip install tweepy

```
##### 3. Run your script as needed, then deactivate the environment when finished:
```bash
deactivate

```

After these steps, you should have a working virtual environment where you can install and manage packages without encountering system-level restrictions. Let me know if you run into any other issues!
