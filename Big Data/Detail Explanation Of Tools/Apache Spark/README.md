# Platforms to Practice Apache Spark for Free (Without Installation)

You can practice Apache Spark for free on the following cloud-based platforms without needing any local installations:

## 1. [Databricks Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html)
Databricks offers a free version of its platform called the Community Edition, where you can run Spark jobs and practice Spark programming. It provides a notebook interface and supports both Python and Scala for Spark jobs.

## 2. [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
While Google Colab primarily supports Python, you can configure it to run Apache Spark by installing the necessary libraries. It offers free access to limited compute power.

You can install Spark in Colab using the following code:
```bash
!apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk-headless -qq > /dev/null
!wget -q http://apache.osuosl.org/spark/spark-3.1.2/spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
!tar xf spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
!pip install -q findspark
import os
os.environ["JAVA_HOME"] = "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
os.environ["SPARK_HOME"] = "/content/spark-3.1.2-bin-hadoop2.7"

```

## 3. [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels)
Kaggle offers free Jupyter notebook environments with GPUs, where you can also run Spark by installing it. You can use a similar setup as with Google Colab to configure Spark.

## 4. [Microsoft Azure Free Tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
Azure provides a free tier that gives you limited access to their services, including Databricks. You can use this to practice Apache Spark on a small scale.

## 5. [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
AWS offers a free tier where you can create small EMR (Elastic MapReduce) clusters to run Spark jobs. This gives you real cloud experience with Spark, albeit with limited resources.
