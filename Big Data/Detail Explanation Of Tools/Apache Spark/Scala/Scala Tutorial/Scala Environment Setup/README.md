# Installing Scala

Scala can be installed on any UNIX-flavored or Windows-based system. Before you start installing Scala on your machine, you must have **Java 1.8 or greater** installed on your computer.

## Steps to Install Scala

### Step 1: Verify Your Java Installation

First of all, you need to have the **Java Software Development Kit (SDK)** installed on your system. To verify this, execute any of the following two commands depending on the platform you are working on.

If the Java installation has been done properly, then it will display the current version and specification of your Java installation. A sample output is given in the following table.

| Platform  | Command  | Sample Output |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| **Windows** | Open Command Console and type − | \>java –version |
| | Java version "1.8.0_31" | |
| | Java (TM) SE Run Time | |
| | Environment (build 1.8.0_31-b31) | |
| | Java Hotspot (TM) 64-bit Server | |
| | VM (build 25.31-b07, mixed mode) | |
| **Linux** | Open Command terminal and type − | $java –version |
| | Java version "1.8.0_31" | |
| | Open JDK Runtime Environment (rhel-2.8.10.4.el6_4-x86_64) | |
| | Open JDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.31-b07, mixed mode) | |

We assume that the readers of this tutorial have **Java SDK version 1.8.0_31** installed on their system.

In case you do not have Java SDK, download its current version from [Java SE Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and install it.
