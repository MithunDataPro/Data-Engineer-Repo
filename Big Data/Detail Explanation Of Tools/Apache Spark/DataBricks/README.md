## Using Databricks on Cloud vs Databricks Website: Cost Comparison

### Databricks Community Edition (Website):
- **Cost**: Free (with limited resources)
- **Usage**: Suitable for learning, small-scale data processing, and practicing Spark jobs.
- **Limitations**: Cannot be used for large-scale data engineering tasks or production workloads due to resource constraints.

### Databricks on Cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP):
- **Cost**: Usage-based, meaning you are charged based on the compute and storage resources you use on the cloud platform.
  - **Azure Databricks**: Cost depends on Azureâ€™s pricing model for Databricks clusters, which typically includes VM costs and Databricks service charges.
  - **AWS Databricks**: Charges are based on the instance types (EC2), storage, and Databricks unit prices on AWS.
  - **Google Cloud Databricks**: Pricing depends on the Google Cloud resources you use.
- **Usage**: Ideal for large-scale, production workloads, complex data pipelines, real-time analytics, and machine learning at scale.
- **Cheaper Option**: If you are just learning and experimenting, the **Databricks Community Edition** (on the website) is cheaper as it is free. However, for enterprise-level tasks, **using Databricks on a cloud platform** can be more cost-effective in the long run due to scalability and advanced features.
