# Apache Spark Architecture

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing framework designed for large-scale data processing. It supports multiple programming languages and can handle batch, interactive, and streaming workloads.

## Core Components of Spark Architecture

### 1. **Driver**
- **Role**: The main process that orchestrates the execution of the Spark application.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Translates user code into tasks.
  - Distributes tasks to Executors.
  - Monitors and tracks job progress.

### 2. **Cluster Manager**
- **Role**: Responsible for resource allocation and management across the cluster.
- **Examples**:
  - Standalone Cluster Manager
  - Apache Mesos
  - Hadoop YARN
  - Kubernetes

### 3. **Executors**
- **Role**: Worker nodes that perform the tasks assigned by the Driver.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Execute tasks (partitions of the data).
  - Store intermediate results in memory or disk.
  - Report task progress back to the Driver.

### 4. **Tasks**
- **Role**: The smallest unit of execution in Spark.
- A task runs on a single partition of data.

### 5. **RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)**
- The fundamental data structure in Spark.
- Immutable, distributed collection of objects.
- Supports fault tolerance via lineage graphs.

## Spark Workflow
1. **Submit Application**: User submits a Spark application to the Driver.
2. **Resource Allocation**: The Cluster Manager assigns resources (e.g., CPU, memory) to the Driver and Executors.
3. **Job Execution**:
   - The Driver divides the job into stages.
   - Tasks within stages are executed on Executors.
4. **Data Processing**:
   - Executors process partitions of data in parallel.
   - Intermediate results are communicated back to the Driver.
5. **Result**: The Driver collects and returns the final output to the user.

## Spark Execution Modes
1. **Local Mode**: Runs on a single machine, often used for testing or debugging.
2. **Standalone Mode**: Sparkâ€™s built-in cluster manager.
3. **YARN Mode**: Integrates with Hadoop's resource manager.
4. **Kubernetes Mode**: Deploys Spark jobs on Kubernetes clusters.
